Procedurally generated HR Data
==============================

By default, a demonstration set of HR data is imported into the MySQL database to `hr.hr_people`. SELECT access to this table is granted to the `identityiq` user.

All data is procedurally generated by a program developed at IDW. No record is intended to resemble any real-life individuals.

# Description of the data

This data represents an imaginary medium-sized grocery store corporation.

Requirements used by the generator follow:

* There are around 33,000 full and part time employees.
* There are two affiliate companies (Primary Grocers Inc and Affiliate Grocers Inc) which have separate manager hierarchies and locations. 
* A few people may have a record at more than one company. For example, Jim worked as a cashier at Affiliate then quit, then later took a job at Primary. 
* Users will have no more than one record per company.
* The manager hierarchy is a consistent tree with multiple layers of managers depending on department size. Managers are mapped by employee number.
* The full assortment of employment situations is represented: pre-hire, current employee, terminated, rehired.
* A small subset of users are current employees on leave (status `L`).

The `employee_number` field is intended as the unique ID.

# Fake SSNs

The dataset includes an `ssn` field with SSN-formatted randomly generated values. These values begin with 9xx so are not valid SSNs. This field is intended for demonstrating or practicing PII management.

# Additional datasets

Additional larger or smaller ramdomly generated user sets are available on request. 

We also have generated university datasets with users having multiple valid affiliations.
