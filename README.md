# Supported versions

As of the July 2023 changes, only versions higher than IIQ 8.0 are supported, as the included database has been updated to the latest MySQL.

Previous versions of the SailPoint IIQ Docker builder support IIQ 7.2, IIQ 7.3, IIQ 8.0, and IIQ 8.1. You can check out previous Git commits if you want to try building those.

# Quick Start

There are several of ways to start your Docker environment:

* [A single-container build](#single-container)
* [A pre-built full stack](#compose-with-a-pre-built-image)
* **[Building your own full stack](#compose-with-build-recommended) (recommended)**
* [Swarm mode](#swarm)

## Single container

I use the single-container build for quick tests and customer demos.

1.  Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2.  Obtain an IdentityIQ zip file from [Compass Downloads](https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/IdentityIQ-Downloads/ct-p/IIQ_downloads). You will need to be a SailPoint customer or partner.
3.  `git clone <this repo>`
4.  `cd sailpoint-docker`
5.  `./build.sh -z /path/to/identityiq-8.3.zip`

The image tagged `latest` can be started standalone using the following Docker command:

    docker run --init -it -d -p8080:8080 git.identityworksllc.com:5005/idw/idw-sailpoint/sailpoint-docker:latest

Standalone startup takes about 3-4 minutes on my Macbook Pro, including the database installation and import of IIQ's init.xml. IIQ will be available on port 8080 after startup.

### Runtime MySQL install

In single-container mode, the startup script will install and configure MySQL as part of container startup, rather than at build time. This means your container will need network access. 

This also makes the `--init` argument to `docker run` very important, as Docker may not otherwise terminate the MySQL service on container shutdown.

### Oddities that are okay

If you're following the logs, you will notice the MySQL database start up and then shut down again. This is intended to do some initialization of database files and is normal.

You will also see the following sporadic errors and warnings, especially during startup. These can be safely ignored.

* `ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)`
* `mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.`
* `ERROR 1146 (42S02) at line 1: Table 'identityiq.spt_database_version' doesn't exist`
* `ls: cannot access '/opt/iiq/plugins/*.zip': No such file or directory`

## Compose with a pre-built image

**This option is for Identity Works internal use only. Sorry. We aren't allowed to distribute IIQ binaries.**

On a Linux or Linux-like infrastructure:

* Install Docker and Docker Compose (or Docker for Mac/Windows)
* Authenticate to the internal IDW Docker registry
* Grab the docker-compose.yml file from [this snippet](https://git.identityworksllc.com/idw/idw-sailpoint/sailpoint-docker/snippets/16) and save it locally
* Go to that directory and run `docker-compose up -d`

The `latest` tag in the registry refers to 7.3p3, so that will be the default version started.

## Docker Compose with build (recommended)

On a Linux or Linux-like infrastructure:

1.  Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2.  Obtain an IdentityIQ zip file from [Compass Downloads](https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/IdentityIQ-Downloads/ct-p/IIQ_downloads).
3.  `git clone <this repo>`
4.  `cd sailpoint-docker`
5.  `./build.sh -z /path/to/identityiq-8.3.zip -p /path/to/identityiq-8.3p3.jar` (for example)
6.  Start up a standalone stack with `docker-compose up -d`.

IIQ will now be available on port 8080.

### Initialization container

A container called `iiq-init` will run on startup in the default configuration. This is a transient *init container*, which will do all of the database configuration and import of artifacts, then exit permanently. All other IIQ containers will wait (using the `docker-done` service) for the init container to finish before starting.

### Scaling

To scale IIQ, use a docker-compose command like `docker-compose up -d --scale iiq=3`, which will start 3 IIQ nodes. The IIQ instances will name their Server objects `iiq1`, `iiq2`, etc, but this does not necessarily correspond to the replica labeling (`iiq_2`) in Docker.

You can also scale at runtime using the same command after startup, which will add or remove nodes as needed. Note that the nodes added and removed are decided by Docker, not by their startup order or counter ID. This means that on scaling down, you may lose `iiq1` but keep `iiq2`.

## Swarm

If you would like to run the stack in Swarm Mode, you will need to make a couple changes to the Compose file first:

1.  Uncomment the section under service `loadbalancer` indicated in a comment.
2.  Move all `labels:` tags under a `deploy:` tag.

If you are interested in Swarm, I trust that you otherwise know what you're doing.

# Building

On initial download, you will need to build the images in your local Docker environment. We cannot ship our Docker configuration with IdentityIQ components and your installation may have its own build process. Therefore, we've provided a build script that will automatically place the appropriate artifacts in the appropriate locations.

## With the provided build.sh script

You must specify a way to obtain an identityiq.war using one of these three flags:

* `-z`: A local identityiq-7.x.zip
* `-b`: An SSB build folder (or Git repository), which must contain a build.xml
* `-w`: An already-built WAR file

The WAR file will be staged to `iiq-build/src/identityiq.war`. 

Once everything is staged, the build script will build the Docker images.

Additional parameters:

* `-p`: Specify the path to a JAR file for a major patch, such as 7.3p2
* `-e`: Specify the path to an e-fix archive
* `-m`: Specify the patch to a plugin archive (think "m" for "module")
* `-t`: If you specify an SSB build, this value will be given as SPTARGET
* `-c`: Specify the path to a trusted certificate that will be imported into the Java keystore

You can specify multiple plugins, e-fixes, and trusted certificates by repeating the option, such as `./build.sh -m plugin1.zip -m plugin2.zip`.

If you specify an SSB build, you do not need to specify any patches or hotfixes, since these are included in the build.

## Manually 

If you want to do it yourself or use a custom build, you can copy a supported `identityiq.war` to `iiq-build/sailpoint` manually and then invoke `docker-compose build`. This is ultimately what the build script is doing behind the scenes.

There are other folders in `iiq-build/src` that you can add artifacts to as needed: 

* `patch`: For a patch JAR file (only one please)
* `efix`: For hotfix zip files
* `plugins`: For plugin zip files
* `certs`: For trusted certificates to import

# Where are the logs?

This is a common question from people who are new to Docker and containerization. As a best practice, Dockerized applications are not supposed to write their logs to files. Container engines like Docker have their own log management infrastructure that captures any lines written to stdout and then, ideally, ships them off to some sort of a log aggregator, like Splunk or ELK. IIQ embedded in Docker is not different in this regard.

Since this is just a POC, we obviously don't have any kind of logging infrastructure in place, so you will need to view the Docker log output directly. From the root folder of this project (where `docker-compose.yml` is located), run: `docker-compose logs -f iiq`.

# Additional scripts

Additional scripts for managing the Compose environment are provided in the `bin` directory.

TODO document these

## Entering the shell

You can enter the shell of any of the running containers using the provided `enter-shell.sh` script. 

By default, with no parameters, you will enter the primary iiq-master container. You can specify a WHICH environment variable to enter another. For example: `WHICH=iiq-secondary ./enter-shell.sh`

## Stopping

To stop the stack, run `docker-compose down`.

# SSB

If you use SailPoint's "Standard Services Build" (SSB) suite, the build script can automatically run the build for you.

If you use the `-b` flag to the startup script, your SSB project will be built using `ant clean war`. The WAR file will be provided to the container and startup will proceed normally. Since the schema is regenerated before import, no special action is needed for extended attributes or patches.

## Git integration

If the value passed to `-b` looks like a git repository, the whole SSB build will be pulled from Git before build.

Pulling an entire SSB build from Git can take forever. The script tracks the most recent value passed to `-b`, and if the repository is the same as last time, it does not do a `clone` but instead a `pull`.

# Database

By default, the Compose stack uses Microsoft's `mssql:latest` image. This is free for use in non-Production environments. The SA password is available in `docker-compose.yml`. 

To switch to MySQL, you can change the `DATABASE_TYPE` environment variable in the compose file to `mysql`. The startup script will run appropriate database installation commands depending on the type you specify.

## Local database

If you start up a standalone container, or set a `DATABASE_TYPE` of `local`, a MySQL 8.0 database will be installed within the IIQ container on startup.

# Services

This Docker Compose file will start up several services:

* db_mysql: MySQL 8.0
* db: The latest MSSQL developer image
* mail: MailHog
* ldap: OpenLDAP
* ssh: An SSH server
* loadbalancer: The load balancer Traefik
* iiq: IdentityIQ nodes (which can be replicated ad nauseum)
* counter and done: Utility services to assist with startup of the stateful IIQ services

These should be sufficient to demonstrate most of the non-proprietary connectors in IIQ. The service names double as the hostnames from within the containers, so IIQ sees the database host as having DNS name `db`, LDAP as having the DNS name `ldap`, etc. 

Default usernames and passwords are available in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Active Directory and other Windows connectors will require using a Windows installation. The IQService does run in Mono but the user management APIs required for these connectors are not present outside of Windows.

## Load balancer

The load balancer [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) is used to forward traffic to one or more backend IIQ hosts. It is granted access to the Docker socket which essentially gives it "root" access to your Docker environment. It will monitor containers as they start and forward traffic among them automatically. It is configured for sticky sessions by default, as IIQ requires. Once the stack is started, you can access the Traefik dashboard at `http://localhost:28080`.

# SERI

SERI is SailPoint's IIQ sales demo package available to partners.

If `WEB-INF/config/seri` is detected by the startup script, the SERI init objects will be imported automatically. 

Additionally, you will be able to use the `seri.sh` script to more easily push in any SERI component after IIQ is started. If the component is in the folder `config/seri/catalog/UseCase-XYZ`, you would specify `UseCase-XYZ` as the parameter to `seri.sh`. The `setup.xml` file in that folder will be imported. If the folder you specify begins with *Plugin*, the contents will be imported as one or more plugins instead.

# Accelerator Pack

If the IIQ Accelerator Pack is detected via the XML file `WEB-INF/config/init-acceleratorpack.xml`, it will be automatically imported.
